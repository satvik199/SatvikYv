👋 Hi, I'm **Satvik Yadav** — a curious fullstack developer and aspiring Prompt Engineer with a passion for building AI-powered tools and crafting smooth, interactive web experiences.

🔧 Currently working on:
- 🤖 **Agent-Creator** – An AI content generation project powered by Node.js
- 🌐 My personal portfolio – Built with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, GSAP & Locomotive Scroll

💡 What I love:
- Building intelligent systems that solve real problems
- Designing smooth scroll and animation experiences
- Exploring how prompt engineering can unlock the future of AI agents

🎯 On a mission to:
- Master advanced JavaScript (closures, async, performance, and more)
- Land a role in a cutting-edge AI or frontend engineering team
- Make people smile through fun, helpful, and delightful creations 😄


🧠 Fun Fact: I believe that code is not just logic—it's a creative superpower.
